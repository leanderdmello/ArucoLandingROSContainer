# Frame convention example

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the frame convention conversion library `ros_frame_convention`. The example code is written in C++ and uses the `ros_frame_convention` library that is supplied in the `creos-sdk-ros-dev` package. View the [main.cpp](src/main.cpp) file to see how to use the frame convention conversion library. The example specifically shows the usage of a convention conversion from ENU/FLU to NED/FRD of an odometry message.

```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run frame_convention_example frame_convention_example
```
